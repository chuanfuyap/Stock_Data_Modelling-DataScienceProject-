# Stock_Data_Modelling-DataScienceProject-
Project for Springboard's Data Science Intensive Course (and coursework)

These are collections of coursework and the capstone project for the Data Science Intensive Course by Springboard.

The Capstone Project is a regression machine learning model to predict values of Microsoft's stocks by using the statistical properties of 
the data and investor's sentiment value. Additionally, the project explored this as a classification problem, on whether to buy, sell or 
hold the stocks.
